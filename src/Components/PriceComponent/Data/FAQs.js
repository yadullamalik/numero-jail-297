    Heading: "How is the subscription fee calculated for paid plans?",
    Description:
      "You will be charged a monthly fee for each member of your team. For paid plans, this fee applies even if you have under 5 active users. You will not be charged for deactivated users. If you deactivate a user, all data associated with the deactivated user will be retained.",

    Heading:
      "You mentioned that Toggl Track is free for up to 5 users. If I’m on a paid plan, do I only need to pay for the 6th user?",
    Description:
      "No, you will have to pay for all 6 members on your plan. We charge for every user because all users benefit from the extra features enabled by paid plans, not just the 6th. For example, all users can create Tasks or assign entries as Billable—all paid plan features.",

  {
    Heading: "Does Toggl Track offer discounts?",
    Description:

    Heading:
      "If I sign up for a Free plan but add 6 users to my Workspace during my free Premium trial, what will happen to the 6th user once the 30 days are up?",
    Description:
      "All users will remain in the Workspace and all time tracking data will remain intact. However, once you’re back on the Free plan, the Workspace will be frozen and no one will be able to track time. To unfreeze the Workspace, reduce the number of active users to 5.",
  },
  {
    Heading:
      "If I use your Premium features during the trial, what happens to all the data related to paid features (Tasks, Billable Rates, etc.) once my Workspace downgrades to the Free plan?",
    Description:
      "The data entered during the trial will be hidden, but not removed or deleted. If you upgrade to a paid plan sometime in the future, the data will become visible again. All the time entries will remain visible—only the associated data from paid features such as Tasks will be hidden.",

    Heading: "Does Toggl Track have desktop or mobile apps? Are they free?",

    Heading:
      "If I have a paid Toggl Plan subscription, do I need to pay for Toggl Track?",
    Description: "Your Toggl Plan subscription will not influence your Toggl Track payment plan.

If you have a paid Toggl Plan subscription, you can take advantage of the Toggl Plan and Track integration to track time within Plan.",
